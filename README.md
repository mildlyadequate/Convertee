# Convertee
 A lightweight and quick to use converter app.
 
 ## Install
 Not yet available on Google Play Store, download the APK from here: 
 [Convertee v0.3.1](https://github.com/mildlyadequate/Convertee/releases/download/v0.3.1-alpha/convertee-alpha-031.apk "Github Releases")
 
 ## Features :toolbox:
 
 ### - A LOT of units
 Right now there are 17 unit types (eg. weight), and more than 170 units (eg. kg) available.
 
 ### - Intuitive controls
 Especially the slider bar allows a quick selection of a specific unit without having to scroll through a list in a popup (which is still an option if you prefer).
 
 ### - Customizable
 Remove any unit type you don't like (No one NEEDS to know binary, right?) as well as any unit you don't want to see (Imperial units maybe?).
 
 ### - Accurate
 You decide how many trailing digits will be displayed!
 
 ### - Expandable
 Need to convert a specific unit type that isn't available yet? Just send me a message!
 
 ## Requirements
 - Minimum Android 5.1 Lollipop (API level 22)
 - Only requires Internet permission to access the Currency Conversion API (Everything else works fine without this permission)
 
 ## Translation
 Currently only in English :uk: and German :de:
