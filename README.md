# Convertee
 A lightweight and quick to use converter app.
 
 ## Features :toolbox:
 
 ### - Intuitive controls
 Especially the slider bar allows a quick selection of a specific unit without having to scroll through a list in a popup (which is still an option if you prefer).
 
 ### - Customizable
 Remove any unit type you don't like (No one NEEDS to know binary, right?) as well as any unit you don't want to see (Imperial units maybe?).
 
 ### - Accurate
 You decide how many trailing digits will be displayed!
 
 ### - Expandable
 Need to convert a specific unit type that isn't available yet? Just send me a message!
 
 ## Requirements
 - Minimum Android 5.1 Lollipop (API level 22)
 - NO Permissions needed at all
 
 ## Translation
 Currently only in English :uk: and German :de:
